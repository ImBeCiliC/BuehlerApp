# BuehlerApp
The Buehler App was Developed for a Freelancer-Project. The Project was made with my friend https://www.linkedin.com/in/klimkolyvanov/ <br>
► He developed the Image-Processing and Algorithms for the Calculation. He was also responsible for the communication with the Project Manager<br>
► My Task was to develop the Android-App, Debugging and Testing<br>
In that case Buehler AG send us the App-Design, App-Icon and Custom-Camera-Buttons.<br>
