## BuehlerApp

The BuehlerApp is a freelance project made by [Klim](https://github.com/milkyklim) and me.

Bühler Group was planning to develop a cloud based photo app for the service personnel in the feed milling industries to enhance efficiency and ensure quality of our customer maintenance service.

Unexperienced service personnel is calculating or estimating a wrong amount of holes in the pellet mill dies when doing the maintenance of the pellet mills on customer site. The **amount of holes** is crucial for the output and wrong information can have serious impacts for the customers.

Our **task** was to make the service personnel’s life easier and ensure quality by developing a photo app. The app should automatically calculate the amount of holes in a pellet mill die using a photo of the die, specified diameter and arc length.

- Klim developed the algorithm, implemented it in [Processing](https://www.processing.org) and embedded it into the Android application. He was also responsible for the communication with the project manager from the Bühler Group.

- I was responsible for the Android application development, debugging and testing.

The design suggestions were provided by Bühler Group.
