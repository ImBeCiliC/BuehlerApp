## BuehlerApp

The BuehlerApp is a freelance project made by [Klim](https://github.com/milkyklim) and me.

► Klim developed the Image-Processing and Algorithms for the Calculation. He was also responsible for the communication with the Project Manager<br>
► My Task was to develop the Android-App, Debugging and Testing<br>
In that case Buehler AG send us the App-Design, App-Icon and Custom-Camera-Buttons.<br>

## Design
The Overall Design was choosen and decided from the Buehler AG design team.
